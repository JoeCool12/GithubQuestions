-New to github?
-What are all of these options?:

        -Repositories
        -Codespaces
        -Projects
        -Stars
        -Gists

-What are all of these features?

-Star: Think of it as a bookmark.

-Repositories: A repository contains all of your 
project's files and each file's revision history.
A repository is a single code base. In most cases
that's just one dedicated software project.

-Projects:  A GitHub Project is just a collection of issues 
(tickets) and a workflow. You can have multiple projects. 
You might for example have a project for bugs and a project 
for features, or you might create a project for a release 
and delete it once the release is complete.

-Gists:  Gists are a particular service offered on that site,
namely code snippets akin to pastebin. However, everything 
is driven by git revision control, so gists also have complete 
revision histories. 

 -Code Spaces: A codespace is a development environment that's 
 hosted in the cloud. You can customize your project for Codespaces
 by committing configuration files to your repository
(often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a 
repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your
project.
